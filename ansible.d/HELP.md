# Overview 

This file is for logging any work/next steps for the `exp-ansible-posh` branch work. The branch work wont be released until its completely finished, so this will help when context switching b/w this and the main branch.

# Work Scope/Tasks
- make ansible playbook to automatically configure and install YCM on a new machine 
    - ycm `sudo` dependencies
    - vimrc plugin install
    - vimrc supertab ultisnips extra configuration for harmony

- add `GIT` info to BASH prompt 
    - convert `.json` ohmyposh themes to `yaml`
        - not needed but doing just for practice with transformaing multiple configuration data types in Python
    - *currently* aiming to keep the prompt as minimal as possible
        - WANTS:
            - ***nord colorscheme***
            - prompt format
            ```
            username@hostname  [git branch info]
             > `COMMANDS GO HERE`
            ```
            - Arrow `>` can be swaped for another symbol if easier, but I want it on its own line separate from the username/hostname/git info
