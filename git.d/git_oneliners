# diff current branch with its origin ((1) actual changes and (2) change summary)
gd "$(git branch --show-current)" "origin/$(git branch --show-current)"

# create origin/BRANCH_NAME on remote and use current work from Local as first push

# check out FZF selected branch
git branch -v  | awk -F' ' '{print $1}' | rg -v "\*" | fzf -1 | xargs git checkout "{}"  >> ~/do
