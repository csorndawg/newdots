This folder and its files were autogenerated from nvim-scissors `ScissorsAddSnippet` function via `:lua require('nvim-scissors')`.

Snippet files in the `snippets/` root folder must follow the `<filetype>.json` naming format.

For specialized snippet files for a given filetype they must be placed within a `snippet/<filetype>/` folder. An example of this is the `snippets/python/debug.json` file which excuslively holds python **PDB** snippets.
